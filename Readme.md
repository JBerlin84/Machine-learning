# Machine learning
In this git repository I'm tracking my path towards learning machine learning.
I will begin my journey by writing everything myself, and only later use libraries and other tools.

This will also be my first project in which I use Python, which might make for some interresting code.

## Tools
Python 3.6

### following libraries are imported solely for visualization purposes:
graphics.py from http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/  
tkinter since graphics.py relies on this.
